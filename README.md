# NLP-for-Nepali-Language
The project is all about Natural Language Processing for the Nepali Language. "Text Summarization" and "Word Segmentation" are implemented in this project. 

## Text Summarization
&rarr; For text summarization, the technique used is TF-IDF. 

## Word Segmentation
&rarr; The dataset includes most common words that are used in nepali language. The dataset has various P.O.S. words. <br>
&rarr; The project implements Verbal Inflections. <br>
&rarr; Non-verbal words from the dataset are used as a dictionary to the implemented dictionary based algorithms.<br>
&rarr; Research is done for the verbal part and the most common nepali verbs are categorized into various types. Each type has its own rule of adding of prefixes and suffixes.<br>
&rarr; FSA is implemented for Morphological Recognition.<br>
&rarr; Various Orthographic rules are also taken into consideration while implementing the FSA.<br>
